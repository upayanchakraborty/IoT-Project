This our mini project that we displayed in the 14th Inter University Engineering, Science & Technology Academic Meet 2024 under Innovative model Competition For a sustainable Society.
This is an IoT based Centralized monitoring system demo version. More upgradation required.
Update!
Modified the model so that it will work to minimize energy efficiency but still flaws left to overcome.
Will be working on it.
